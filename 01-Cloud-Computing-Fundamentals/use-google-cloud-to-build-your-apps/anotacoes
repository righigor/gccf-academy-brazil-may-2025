Compute Engine:
  - no upfront investments
  - thousands of virtual CPUs can run on a system thats designed to be fast and offer consistent performance
  - each VM contains the power and functionality of a full-fledged operating system
  - run any computing workload such as web-server hosting, application hosting and application backend

IaaS
  - shae compute resources using vms by virtualizing the hardware

Configurable system
  - Customizable installation, configuration and building;
  - Large, slow anf costly

App Engine
  - Access to programming services to write your code;
  - Seamless, independent and rapid scaling;
  - No fine-tuning the underlying architecture to save cost;

Containers
  - Independent scalability of workloads in PaaS and an abstraction layer of the OS and hardware in IaaS;


KUBERNETES
  - A container orchestration system;
  - Install the system on local servers in the cloud;
  - Manage containers networking and data storage;
  - Deploy rollouts and rollbacks;
  - Monitor and manage container and host health;


LABS
  Creating a Virtual Machine:
    - Create a virtual machine with the Google Cloud Console;
    - Create a virtual machine with the gcloud command-line tool;
    - Deploy a web server and aconnect it to a virtual machine;

  App Engine: Qwik Start:
    - Download an application;
    - Test the application locally;
    - Deploy the application to App Engine;
    - View the application in a web browser;

  Cloud Run Functions: Qwik Start - Command Line:
    - Create a simple cloud function;
    - Deploy and test the function;
    - View logs.

  Kubernetes Engine: Qwik Start:
    - Set a default compute zone;
    - Create a GKE cluster;
    - Get authentication credentials for the cluster;
    - Deploy an application to the cluster;
    - Delete the cluster;
