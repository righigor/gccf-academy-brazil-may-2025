Artificial Intelligence
  An umbrella term that includes anything related to computers mimicking human intelligence.

Machine Learning
  A subset of AI that mainly refers to supervised and unsupervised learining.
  An ML model is only as good as the data it is trained on.


BigQuery ML
  Use SQL queries to create execute machine learning models in BigQuery.

AutoML
  A no-code solution to build ML models on Vertex AI.
  Automates machines learining pipelines to save data scientists from manual work.
  Transfer learning
  Neural Architecture Search finds the optimal model

Custom Training
  Code your own ML enviroment to have control over the ML pipeline.
